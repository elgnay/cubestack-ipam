// controllerRef builds the ownerReference that makes owner the controller of a
// dependent — a claim owned by its VirtualMachine, a NAD owned by its IPRequest.
//
// This is metav1.NewControllerRef with blockOwnerDeletion left off, which is the
// difference that matters. blockOwnerDeletion makes an owner's deletion wait for
// its dependents to go, which is worth having when a dependent holds a finalizer.
// Nothing in this project's chain does: the whole release mechanism is garbage
// collection, VM -> IPRequest -> NAD, so the wait would buy nothing.
//
// It would not be free either. The API server enforces blockOwnerDeletion against
// whoever writes the reference, so turning it on would force this controller to
// hold delete permission on the very objects it serves. A tighter RBAC is worth
// more here than a guarantee nothing needs.
//
// Controller: true is kept, and is load-bearing: it is what Owns() matches on to
// map a NAD's events back to its claim.
