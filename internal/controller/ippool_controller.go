// IPPoolReconciler reconciles an IPPool.
//
// Its whole job is to answer one question: is this pool usable as written? The
// answer goes in status.conditions and nowhere else. In particular there is no
// ledger of allocated addresses here — the set of IPRequests is the only
// authoritative record of who holds what, and a second list would be a second
// thing to keep in step.
//
// The pool's other declared invariant — that its band is disjoint from any other
// NAD serving the same subnet — is deliberately NOT checked. With the shared
// underlay NAD retired, there is no longer a live object to compare against, and
// the remaining overlap risk (an admin hand-writing a conflicting NAD) is bounded
// by RBAC instead: regular users cannot create NADs. What cannot be caught before
// the fact is caught after it, by the audit sweep.
