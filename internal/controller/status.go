// patchStatusIfChanged writes the status subresource only when it differs from
// what the object already carries.
//
// Patch rather than Update: an Update carries the resourceVersion of the object
// we read, and that read is served by the informer cache, which lags the API
// server. Status is this controller's own observed state and needs no
// compare-and-swap, so a merge patch drops the precondition instead of
// 409-conflicting and forcing a retry reconcile.
//
// Skipping the write when nothing changed matters more than it looks: the
// controllers return without requeueing on success, so an unconditional write
// would be the only thing generating further reconciles — a slow loop of the
// controller's own making.
//
// The status values are passed in rather than read off the objects because IPPool
// and IPRequest share no interface exposing Status. Passing them keeps the
// comparison type-safe without a type switch.
